# SaaS Product Usage Data Cleaning Project

## 📊 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how I cleaned and analyzed a real-world SaaS usage dataset (1,000+ rows) using Excel and Google Sheets.  
The goal was to transform messy product usage data into actionable insights on user engagement and churn.

## 🧹 Steps
1. Imported raw CSV data from Kaggle (dirty SaaS dataset)
2. Identified and removed duplicates, blanks, and inconsistent date formats
3. Created issue log to note items to identify and document data changes,as well as note items requiring further clarification/troubleshooting.
4. Standardized plan names, currency, and usage metrics
5. Built pivot tables and trend charts for product engagement

## 💡 Key Insights
- PPPP of users showed inconsistent logins due to timezone mismatches
- PPPP of enterprise accounts had incomplete billing data
- Data cleaning improved reporting accuracy by PPPP

## 🛠️ Tools Used
